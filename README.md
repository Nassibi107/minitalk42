## Project Information

The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. The project involves creating a communication program in C, comprising both a client and a server. The server, launched first, displays its PID, and the client takes the server's PID and a string as parameters. Once the server receives the string, it displays it.

### Keep in Mind

- Handle errors sensitively; the program should not quit unexpectedly.
- Ensure no memory leaks.
- Use only one justified global variable.

### Mandatory

- Produce server & client executables.
- The client must communicate a string passed as a parameter to the server (referenced by its process ID), which then displays it.
- Use only SIGUSR1 & SIGUSR2 signals.

### Bonus

- Add a reception acknowledgment system.
- Support Unicode characters.

### Allowed Functions (Manual)

- write
- ft_printf and any equivalent YOU coded
- signal
- sigemptyset & sigaddset
- sigaction
- kill
- getpid
- malloc
- free
- pause
- sleep
- usleep
- exit

# Understanding Signals in Unix and POSIX

In the realm of Unix and POSIX-compliant operating systems, a **signal** serves as a standardized notification message. These messages are dispatched asynchronously to running programs, informing them of specific events.

## Sending a Signal

Signals are transmitted by the operating system's kernel under two primary circumstances:

1. **System-wide Events:** The kernel detects system-wide occurrences such as a divide-by-zero error or the completion of a child process.

2. **Process Request:** A process can explicitly request the dispatch of a signal using the `kill` system call. Remarkably, a process can even signal itself using this mechanism.

It's noteworthy that only a single pending signal of any particular type, such as `SIGCHLD`, can exist at a given time. Until this signal is received, the system refrains from sending additional `SIGCHLD` signals.

## Receiving a Signal

While the operating system appears to multitask, it fundamentally engages in rapid context switching, transitioning between processes seamlessly.

### Signal Actions

Upon receiving a signal, a process can respond in various ways:

- **Terminate:** The process concludes abruptly.
- **Core Dump:** The process terminates while generating a core dumpâ€”a file encapsulating its memory and registers for subsequent analysis.
- **Ignore:** The signal is disregarded, and the program persists in its regular execution.
- **Stop:** The process's execution is suspended until it receives the `SIGCONT` signal.
